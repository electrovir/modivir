# Modivir

The heroic cross-platform music library manager and player. Currently in very early stages.

Heavily based on [`vite-electron-builder`](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder).

# Dev

-   `npm run start`: startup developer Electron app that auto-refreshes when changes are detected.
-   `npm run compile`: output an executable/app for the current system into the `/dist` directory.
-   `npm run type-check`: run TypeScript type checking for all packages.
-   `npm test`: run tests.
-   `npm run test:full`: run all configured tests (including spellchecking, type checking, etc.).
-   `npm run format`: format all code.

Tested on Node.js versions `14` and `16`.
