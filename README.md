# Modivir

The heroic cross-platform music library manager and player. Currently in very early stages.

Heavily based on [`vite-electron-builder`](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder).

# Dev

-   `npm run dev`: startup developer Electron app that auto-refreshes when changes are detected.
-   `npm run compile`: output an executable/app for the current system into the `/dist` directory.
-   `npm run type-check`: run TypeScript type checking.
